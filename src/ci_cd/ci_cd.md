# CI & CD

## Overview

CI/CD, which stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment, aims to streamline and accelerate the software development lifecycle.

Continuous integration (CI) refers to the practice of automatically and frequently integrating code changes into a shared source code repository. Continuous delivery and/or deployment (CD) is a 2 part process that refers to the integration, testing, and delivery of code changes. Continuous delivery stops short of automatic production deployment, while continuous deployment automatically releases the updates into the production environment.

## Why is CI/CD important?

CI/CD helps organizations avoid bugs and code failures while maintaining a continuous cycle of software development and updates. 

As apps grow larger, features of CI/CD can help decrease complexity, increase efficiency, and streamline workflows.

Because CI/CD automates the manual human intervention traditionally needed to get new code from a commit into production, downtime is minimized and code releases happen faster. And with the ability to more quickly integrate updates and changes to code, user feedback can be incorporated more frequently and effectively, meaning positive outcomes for end users and more satisfied customers overall.
